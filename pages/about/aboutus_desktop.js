                <p>
                    Founded in 1986 and headquartered in Mumbai, India, Jainam Jewelers is a wholesale gold-jewelry manufacturer having experience in blending several old and modern designing methods, and using cutting-edge machinery to provide intricate jewelry with unadulterated purity by keeping intact ethical conduct and affordable pricing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since its inception, we have grown to be an all-around jewelry manufacturer to provide a range of luxurious jewellery items like necklaces, chains, anklets, earrings, bracelets, and rings. From the handcrafted artistic touch of our experienced craftsmen to handling all aspects of production, assembly, and packaging—the main principle that guides us on our everyday operations is to be a one-stop-shop for all our clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Equipped with a skilled team of in-house artisans from all over India, we put effort with careful consideration and attention to detail in designing each piece in terms of quality resulting in wonderfully outlined, elegant and fine jewelry in timeless styles. What makes us truly special is entrusting the integrity of our offerings to a team of talented artisans, responsible for making each piece unique with a personal touch and stories worth remembering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From helping to seal the bond with a ring on one’s engagement day, representing the forever promise to a bride by her husband in form of a personalized mangalsutra to marking the birth of a child with the gift of an anklet – these experiences carry forward for a lifetime and makes craftsmanship matter to maintain a customer’s trust.

                <h2>Our history</h2>
                <p>
                    The story of Jainam Jewelers is about a familial company with distinctive roots and a long tradition of excellence in the gold jewelry industry that spans over 75 years. During these years, it has made an exceptional journey starting from a local door-to-door jewelry sales merchant to a large-scale wholesale manufacturing firm, establishing trust and fostering a lifetime of customer loyalty along the way.
                </p>

                <h3>1946-1986: Early years</h3>
                <p>Back in 1946, the late Shri Mahasukhlal Shivlal Gandhi, hailing from a Gujrati Jain family, travelled as a merchant to the states of West Bengal, Bihar, and Gujarat to sell ornamental items like elegant and incisive gold nose pins—a traditional jewelry item known to be made by talented gold craftsmen in our hometown of Wadhwan, Gujarat.</p>
                <p>After 14 years of his endeavors as a merchant, he was able to gradually shift his focus with the successful launch of his jewelry showroom in Wadhwan to begin sales of elegant gold and silver jewelry and accessories like nose-pins, anklets, and earrings along with the vending of refined bullion.</p>
                <p>In 1986, as the demands for products increased, he undertook an in-depth renovation for further expansion of his jewelry business and moved to Surendranagar, Gujarat to venture into the world of wholesale for sales of jewelry items. During this time, his son Tushar set out alone at the age of twenty-four to explore the unchartered territory of Mumbai and went on to build his father’s legacy to larger premises.</p>

                <h3>1986-2017: The next generation of jewelers</h3>
                <p>Following his father’s footsteps, Tushar first became the creative and firm force behind the brand, laying out its groundwork in Zaveri Bazaar, Mumbai. In due course, the initial manufacturing entrusted to the highly skilled craftsmen and selling of traditional jewelry items like mangalsutra, handmade chains, and rings had begun.</p>
                <p>It didn't take long until Jainam, the third descendant of the bloodline, joined to aid the family business in 2017 after the successful completion of his engineering course. What intrigued him to embrace the firm was observing talented local artisans as a child after spending his summers in the family jewelry workshop and driven by his founding father’s determination towards his work.</p>
                <p>With time, he was quick to learn the art of assessing the value and enhancement of precious gems, continuing the legacy of his ancestors to bring innovation and quality to the jewelry market.</p>
                <p>With their fine jewelry design techniques being passed from generation to generation, Tushar and Jainam represent the high-spirited father-son duo behind the manufacturing and B2B wholesale gold jewelry brand “Jainam Jewelers”.</p>
            
                <h3>Today</h3>
                <p>At present, Jainam Jewelers continues to serve small to large-scale retail jewelry stores by the provision of precious jewels holding an exceptional appeal. We have strived constantly to create high-class quality designs and improve our manufacturing technology for a better workflow. In the future, we will honor our pledge to maintain sustained excellence.</p>
                <p>Over 30 years, we have become the leading supplier of Mangalsutras in the Indian state of Gujarat. There is a focus on further expansion to build a consistent brand presence in every locality as well as we plan to get into exports by the end of this year, having opened a second manufacturing unit other than the one in Mumbai in 2020.</p>
